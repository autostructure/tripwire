2016-10-14 Release 0.1.0
-Release V1 Tripwire module
-Release V1.4 will be a final release before releasing v2 production test ready in a few days.
  The module has undergone some changes, now the module will set the service so that it is chkconfig handled and maintained properly.
  I have added the init.d script need to be put in place before the initial start of the service, this ensures the OS can read the service status, and use start and stop functions
-Release V1.5.0 Will use the profile parameter to define the install directory

-Release v1.7.0 will allow a person to search hiera in the profile for the triipwire_installdir, I didn't want to expose internal data structure.
  I also cleaned up the code and deleted some unneeded comments

-Release v2.0.0 will be production ready test. We have setup the spec helper functions for testing, I have established the install directory to be parsed from hiera. Comments and code has been cleaned up.

-reverting back to 0.6.0 to test RHEL 6 and RHEL 7 chkconfig and systemd compatibility

-Release 2.1.0 will allow the tripwire to be installed on RHEL 6 and RHEL 7 boxes due to their difference in handling services
-Release 2.2.0 fixed some whitespace, the stdlib dependency, our org has to broaden the scope to be compliant with other modules, this has in effect lowered our 5.0 puppet forge score
