2016-10-14 Release 0.1.0
-Release V1 Tripwire module
-Release V1.4 will be a final release before releasing v2 production test ready in a few days.
  The module has undergone some changes, now the module will set the service so that it is chkconfig handled and maintained properly.
  I have added the init.d script need to be put in place before the initial start of the service, this ensures the OS can read the service status, and use start and stop functions
-Release V1.5.0 Will use the profile parameter to define the install directory
